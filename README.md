# sonification_of_spectra
PureData patches, data, and other resources relating to the sonification of stellar spectra and the associated Honors Project for my B.A. in Music Composition

File descriptions:




**spectral_patch_dixon.zip**
> The Pd patch containing all necessary spectral data.
> The GUI is **SpectralMain_FINAL.pd**

**OBAFGKM.mp3**
> A 5 minute sample of the interface; direct recording of the improvised trio mentioned in the associated paper.

**single_star.mp3**
> A short sample of the sonification of star 40, including the bass (temperature) note and a sequence of random spectral notes.

**block_chords.mp3**
> A short sample of the sonification of stars 15, 69, and 120 (in that order), including the bass (temperature) note and three iterations of the block chord for each spectrum.

**hydrogen_visible.txt**
> The list of hydrogen spectral lines in the visible spectrum obtained from NIST

**helium_visible.txt**
> The list of helium spectral lines in the visible spectrum obtained from NIST

**hydrogen_visible.mp3**
> Three iterations of the block chord created by scaling down and combining all spectral lines of hydrogen at their relative intensities.

**helium_visible.mp3**
> Three iterations of the block chord created by scaling down and combining all spectral lines of helium (He I) at their relative intensities.
